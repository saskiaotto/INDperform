    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="details"><a class="anchor" href="#details"></a>Details</h2>

    <p>In the case of non-linear IND responses to pressures first derivatives
of the response curve are calculated to identify whether the IND ceases
to respond at the lower or upper end of the pressure range (relevant for
sub-crit. 9.2).</p>
<p><strong>First Derivative:</strong></p>
<p>The first derivative of a smoothing function i.e. s`(x),
represents the instantaneous rate of change of a dependent variable y to
that of the independent variable x. It tells us whether a function is
increasing or decreasing, and by how much. This information is reflected by
the slope of the tangent line to a point x on the graph of a function.
A positive slope tells us that, as x increases, s(x) also increases.
Derivatives can be applied to any function, even one as potentially
complex as a fitted spline function, by using the method of finite
differences (Trenkel and Rochet, 2009) as done in the <code><a href='cond_boot.html'>cond_boot</a></code>
function: The local first derivatives of the fitted GAM(M) time series
is estimated as the difference between fitted values at time step t and
t + d divided by d, where d is a small value, e.g. 1E-7.</p>
<p><strong>Confidence intervals (CI) based on a conditional bootstrap:</strong></p>
<p>By calculating approximate confidence intervals for s`(x), it may
be determined whether or not apparent IND changes are statistically
significant, i.e. whether the non-zero estimate obtained for
the slope is distinguishable from zero given the uncertainty in the
estimate (Fewster et al., 2000). To estimate the CI of
the estimated first derivative, a conditional bootstrap is
carried out by resampling from the GAM residuals (in the
<code><a href='cond_boot.html'>cond_boot</a></code> function) (Large <em>et al.</em>, 2013).
This approach has the advantage to retain the information in the
pressure variable and to be distribution-free.</p>
<p>In specific, new IND time series are created in <code><a href='cond_boot.html'>cond_boot</a></code> by
resampling from the residuals of the original IND-Pressure GAM(M) and
adding these to the original IND time series repeatedly (the number of
repetitions is defined by n_boot).
A separate GAM(M) is then fitted to each bootstrap IND
time series in <code><a href='cond_boot.html'>cond_boot</a></code>, using the same effective degrees
of freedom (edf) as found optimal for the original IND time series. For
each of the bootstrapped GAMs, predicted IND time series given an evenly
spaced pressure sequence are produced for which the first derivatives
are calculated. Confidence intervals are computed by sorting the
bootstrapped derivatives into ascending order and calculating the
upper and lower percentiles defined by the <code>ci</code> argument (the
default is the 2.5% and 97.5% percentiles representing the 95% CI).</p>
<p>A problem with GAMMs is that the smoothing parameters cannot be fixed,
because the <code><a href='https://rdrr.io/pkg/mgcv/man/gamm.html'>gamm</a></code> function will treat the wiggly
components of the smooth terms as random effects, the variance of which
to be estimated by lme. Hence, the GAMMs refitted on the bootstrapped IND
time series are allowed to have every shape from linear to the max. edfs
set originally. This leads to often positive as well as negative linear
smoothers, which increases the confidence intervals of both fitted
smoothers as well as derivative. When the IND response is weak and/or
the error around the smoother high, the implemented routine to estimate
the proportion of pressure range with significant slope can lead to 0%.
For those models, the method `approx_deriv` can be applied for comparison.</p>
<p><strong>Calculating the proportion of pressure range:</strong></p>
<p>The lack of any further IND response to pressure changes at
its minimum or maximum measured is noted when zero is contained
within the CI of the first derivative and quantified by calculating the
proportion of points (evenly distributed along the pressure axis)
inside the CI for scoring criteria 10.2. In specific,
<code>calc_deriv</code> implements a routine, which identifies
first which pressure values has a slope of zero (see the returned
list-column <code>zero_in_conf</code>). It then checks whether the first
value in <code>zero_in_conf</code> is TRUE (i.e., the lowest value of the
evenly spaced pressure sequence has zero slope). If so, the first value
in the vector zic_start_end (see the returned list-column
<code>zic_start_end</code>) is also set to TRUE, meaning it goes into
the proportion calculation as no IND response. The routine proceeds
to the next values <code>zero_in_conf</code> and stops at the first FALSE value.
It then starts the same procedure from end of the <code>zero_in_conf</code>
vector. The proportion of pressure range (returned as <code>prop</code>
variable in the output tibble) reflects the proportion of FALSE values
in <code>zero_in_conf</code>.</p>
