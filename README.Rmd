## Overview

INDperform is an R package for validating the performance of ecological state indicators and assessing the ecological status based on a suite of indicators.

## Installation

Install the CRAN version:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("INDperform")
```

Or install the development version from GitHub:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("saskiaotto/INDperform")
```

If you encounter a clear bug, please file a minimal reproducible example on github. For questions email me any time.

## Usage

**For more information, documentation and examples of use, please see INDperform website at [https://saskiaotto.github.io/INDperform/](https://saskiaotto.github.io/INDperform/)** 

For guidance on how to apply the functions step-by-step see also the [INDperform cheatsheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saskiaotto/cheatsheets/476bad4a8876939a7b3e1784a5bf61567ed4a715/Cheatsheet_INDperform_v0.1.0.pdf). We are currently working on the Vignette but if you want more information on the framework for quantifying IND performances and its statistical tools implemented in this package see

## Important News


In Version 0.2.2 some adjustments were made to account for changes in packages INDperform depends on and a minor bug fixed in the NRMSE model prediction plot. Some of the plotting functions include now also titles in the individual panels. A data validation routine was added to check for unwanted characters in indicator or pressure names which caused models to not build. For more details see the [NEWS]( https://saskiaotto.github.io/INDperform/news/index.html) file.

---

In Version 0.2.1 a minor bug with different internal test results under different R versions was fixed by modifying some tests. But this bug did not affect the modelling results or performance of the previous version.

---

Version 0.2.0 has been released on CRAN 2019-02-10! The new version includes a few internal changes as adjustments to updated packages it depends on. Major changes changes include a new NRMSE calculation based on the standard deviation and back-transformation (see [https://www.marinedatascience.co/blog/2019/01/07/normalizing-the-rmse/](https://www.marinedatascience.co/blog/2019/01/07/normalizing-the-rmse/) for the motivation), an NRMSE stand-alone function (`nrmse()`) and a function that allows the calculation of the distance matrix averaged across groups (i.e. a weighted distance matrix) (`dist_sc_group()`).
