\title{Diagnostic plots for a fitted GAM, GAMM or threshold-GAM(M)}
\usage{
plot_diagnostics(model_list)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_list}{A list with models of class gam(m) and/or thresh_gam,
e.g. the list-column \code{model} from the \code{\link{model_gam}} output
tibble.}
}
\value{
The function returns a \code{\link[tibble]{tibble}}, which is a trimmed down version
of the data.frame(), including the following elements:
\describe{
  \item{\code{ind}}{Indicator names.}
  \item{\code{press}}{Pressure names.}
  \item{\code{cooks_dist}}{A list-column of ggplot2 objects that show the
              Cook`s distance of all observations, which is a leave-one-out
              deletion diagnostics to measure the influence of each
              observation. Data points with a large Cook`s distance (> 1)
              are considered to merit closer examination in the analysis.}
  \item{\code{acf_plot}}{A list-column of ggplot2 objects that show  the
              autocorrelation function for the residuals. NAs in the time
              series due to real missing values, test data extraction or
              exclusion of outliers are explicitly considered.}
  \item{\code{pacf_plot}}{A list-column of ggplot2 objects that show the
              partial autocorrelation function for the residuals. NAs are
              explicitly considered.}
  \item{\code{resid_plot}}{A list-column of ggplot2 objects that show residuals
              vs. fitted values.}
  \item{\code{qq_plot}}{A list-column of ggplot2 objects that show  the
             quantile-quantile plot for normality.}
  \item{\code{gcvv_plot}}{A list-column of ggplot2 objects that show  for a
             threshold-GAM the development of the generalized cross-validation
             value at different thresholds level of the modifying pressure
             variable. The GCV value of the final chosen threshold should be
             distinctly lower than for all other potential thresholds, i.e.,
             the line should show a pointy negative peak at this threshold.
             If this is not the case, e.g. the trough is very wide with similar
             GCV values for nearby thresholds, the threshold-GAM is not
             optimal and should not be favored over a GAM despite the better
             LOOCV (leave-one-out cross-validation value).}
  \item{\code{all_plots}}{A list-column of ggplot2 objects that show all
             five (six if threshold-GAM) plots together. For this plot,
             drawing canvas from the \code{cowplot} package were added
             on top of ggplot2.}

\description{
\code{plot_diagnostics} takes a list of models of class `gam`, `gamm`
or `thresh_gam` or a mix of those and produces some diagnostic
information of the fitting procedure and results. The function returns a
tibble with 6 list-columns containing individual plots (ggplot2 objects)
and one list-column containing a plot that shows all diagnostic plots
together.
}
\details{
The function can deal with any model of the classes `gam`, `gamm` or
`thresh_gam` as long as the input is a flat list. That means:
\itemize{
  \item If only one model is provided as input coerce the model explicitly
        to class `list`. An input such as model_gam_ex[1, "model"] will not work
        as the class is a tibble. Use instead model_gam_ex$model[1].
  \item If the input are one or more threshold-GAMs selected from
        the \code{\link{test_interaction}} output (variable \code{thresh_models}
        the model list features a nested structure:
        each IND~pressure pair (row) might have more than one threshold-GAM.
        To remove the nested structure use e.g. the \code{\link[purrr]{flatten}}
        function (see examples).
