\usage{
plot_spiechart(
  summary_tbl,
  col_press_type = NULL,
  col_crit8_11 = NULL,
  lab_size = 6,
  title_size = 8
)
}
\arguments{
\item{summary_tbl}{The output tibble from the
\code{\link{summary_sc}} function.}

\item{col_press_type}{Colors for the spie chart slices representing
 criteria 9 (sensitivity; opaque) and 9 (robustness; transparent).

 The colors distinguish the different pressure types. The default
 is set to the RColourBrewer palette "Set1".}

\item{col_crit8_11}{Colors for the spie chart slices representing
criteria 8 (trend) and 11 (management application). The default is
set to cyan1 and yellow2.}

\item{lab_size}{Size for the labels naming the significant pressures. The default is 6.}

\item{title_size}{Size for the title naming the indicator. The default is 8.}
}
\value{
The function returns a list of \code{\link[ggplot2]{ggplot}} objects.
}
\description{
\code{plot_spiechart} generates for each indicator in the scoring
tibble a ggplot2-based spie chart to visualize the scores of each
criterion.
}
\details{
The overall performance of each tested IND is illustrated using a spie chart,
which has been shown to be a well-suited graphical tool for
displaying multivariate data in comparative indicator evaluations
(Stafoggia \emph{et al.}, 2011). A spie chart superimposes a normal pie chart with
a modified polar area chart to permit the comparison of two sets of related
data, e.g. the maximum achievable scores and each INDâ€™s realized scores. In this
function, the slice width is kept constant, while the length of the slices
represents the percentage of scores achieved, with the boundary line (i.e. the
inner gray circle) indicating the full 100%.

The two unlabeled slices at the top represent the trend (right) and management
(left) criteria. The sensitivity and robustness scores are shown individually for
each pressure where a significant relationship was found. These are the labeled
slices grouped by their pressure type represented by dotted division lines and the
segmented outer gray circle as well as pressure type-specific colors (sensitivity
scores are displayed in opaque color, robustness scores in transparent color).

The plot slices adjust to the number of criteria used for the scoring function
(that are present in crit_scores_tmpl).
